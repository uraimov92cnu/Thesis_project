# MultiTask Classification: Age Gender Race

One of my side projects for multioutput Convolutional Neural Networks based on Age, Gender and Race prediction model. The model is conducted on [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) to classify both age ang gender. I made a model project with pre-trained model [DenseNet.](https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.06993) 

### Prerequisites
